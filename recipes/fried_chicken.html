        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This deliciously juicy and crispy Louisiana fried chicken is my grandmother and great grandmother's family recipe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken wings</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Corn starch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium size bowl mix together the eggs and milk. Add ALMOST all of the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (reserve a dash of each for seasoning the chicken pieces). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a dash of the remaining salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder onto both sides of the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Put the flour in a plastic bag. One piece at a time, dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture then add to the plastic bag. Shake the bag so that the flour is covering each piece of chicken.</li>
            <li>You can check to see if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling a little flour in the skillet. If it fries, it's hot enough! Place the chicken pieces in the skillet. After about 5 minutes, turn the chicken over. Let chicken fry for about 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked through and the juices run clear.</li>
        </ol>
